     <p>Dear Reader,</p>
     <p>Hi, Matt Milner, Founder and CEO of <span class="text-style-color">Crowdability</span> here...<br>
      As you know, I’m about to reveal the details behind a groundbreaking device...</p>

   <div class="detail-container">
    <p>In fact, it was originally designed to help combat bio-terrorism and chemical attacks...
     But after the coronavirus appeared earlier this year...
     The inventor of this technology decided to start a company to fight this pandemic…
     And that’s when he secured the exclusive patents to this device.
     Meaning, this is the only company in the world that has the ability to commercialize and sell this technology.
     And as you’ll discover, not only could this technology help protect people across the globe... and get them
     back to work...
     But it could potentially hand investors like you <span class="text-style-bold">massive</span> profits…</p>

     <p>And that’s all with just one investment!
      I know that might sound far fetched...
      But in a moment, you’ll see why I’m so confident in this forecast.
      You see, my business partner, Wayne Mulligan and I have spent the past two months diving into scientific research
      papers and peer-reviewed journals...</p>
     <p>And what they discovered is extraordinary...
      Basically, they discovered a classified military-research project...
      And the goal of this military project was clear:
      To develop a technology to kill bacteria — in mid-air, instantaneously.
      Now, initially, this project was designed to fight off bio-terrorist attacks...
      But as a number of tests and studies eventually proved, this technology has the potential not just to kill
      bacteria, but to kill various pathogens, too...
      Pathogens like the coronavirus. Which is why, after the coronavirus pandemic swept the world earlier this year,
      the inventor of this technology made a decision...
      He decided to leverage the technology he’d developed for the military...
      And use it to create a device to protect ordinary citizens like you...
      And now he’s started a groundbreaking company — a private startup company — that’s about to release this device
      commercially...
      So consumers like you — and like all of us — can be protected from the coronavirus… whether we’re in our home, our
      office, or even a restaurant or a store.</p>

   <h2>Essentially, this device acts like an<br> “Airborne Vaccine”...</h2>
   <div class="width">
    <p>But instead of injecting people like you with a vaccine...
     It’s designed to eliminate — to actually kill — all the coronavirus molecules in the air around you.Look, our
     entire team has been researching all of the products and technologies aimed at fighting the coronavirus for months
     now.
     And the fact is, we’ve never seen <span class="bold">ANYTHING</span> like this device before.
     And I can almost guarantee that you haven’t either.
     That’s because this company has secured the exclusive patent to this technology...
     In fact, here’s the patent — I’m putting it right up on your screen so you can see it in black and white.</p>

   <h2>How <span class="bold-header">BIG</span> This Business Could Become!</h2>
   <div class="width">
    <p>Unlike many complicated Silicon Valley startups that give everything away for free and hope to make money down
     the road...
     This company’s business model is very simple and straightforward…
     Basically, it’s going to sell its products to consumers like us, and to businesses, too.
     And its devices will cost about $1,000.
     Now, at first blush, that number might sound high...
     But that price-point is comparable to the high-end HEPA filters you can buy currently...</p>
    <img src="images/image-6.png" alt="#####">
    <p>And keep in mind, this new device is infinitely more powerful and effective than standard HEPA filters.
     So now let’s talk about how big this business could potentially get...
     There are roughly 128 million households in the United States...
     And another 32 million businesses.
     So the potential market in the U.S. alone is very, very large.
     In fact, according to Grand View Research, in 2019 — that’s before the pandemic — the global air purifier market
     was valued at $8 billion.
     An $8 billion market. That was huge already.
     But because of the pandemic, a research company called Arizton is forecasting the market will soon reach $90
     billion.
     So let’s say this startup we’ve been telling you about is able to capture even just a tiny fraction of this
     market...

   <h2>How much could early investors like you make in profits?</h2>
   <p class="center-text">(HINT: It could be as much as $1.2 million!)</p>
   <div class="width">
    <p>Well, today, you have the chance to invest in this company at a market value of just $5 million...
     So, even at the LOWEST end of our forecasts, you’d be selling your stake at a market value of $150 million.
     That’s a 2,900% profit.
    </p>
    <img src="images/image-7.png" alt="image">
    <p>Again, that’s like turning every $1,000 you invest into $30,000...
     And every $10,000 you invest into $300,000!
     And if this company ends up hitting the top end of your sales projections...
     Well, then you’re talking about potential profits of 11,900%!
    </p>
    <img src="images/image-8.png" alt="image">
    <p>That’s like turning a $1,000 investment into $120,000...
     And $10,000 into $1.2 million!
     And keep in mind, this is all based on the company capturing far less than 1% of the overall market...
     And furthermore, it doesn’t take into account how vastly superior this company’s technology is compared to its
     competitors.
     That’s why we told you earlier that our 2,900% profit forecast might turn out to be conservative.
     And it helps explain why we’ve been so excited to share this opportunity with you.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
     <img src="images/image-9.png" alt="image">
    </div>

    <p>Frankly, this could become one of the most profitable investments that we’ve ever identified.
     And that’s why I’ve compiled all the details about this opportunity into a special new research report — a
     report that I’m going to be releasing here in just a moment...
     It’s called: The COVID-Killer: How to Turn $10,000 into $300,000 With One Investment.
     And in just a minute, I’ll show you how to download a FREE copy of it right now.
     But before I do, I want to tell you about another investment I recently identified...

   <h2>Only 250 members will be able to take advantage of this offer!</h2>
   <div class="width">
    <p>You see, early-stage companies are regulated by the SEC…
     And one of the things the SEC regulates is how much money these companies can raise — and in turn, how many
     investors they can accept.
     Therefore, I need to keep a strict limit on how many people can join this service…
     That’s why I can only open up a small number of new membership spots today.
     Basically, this is how Wayne and I ensure that all of our subscribers can get into these deals.
     So, even though we’ve had more than 100,000 people join our free and paid newsletters...
     We can only allow 250 of you to take advantage of this special offer today.
     Once those 250 spots have been filled, we’re shutting this offer down, possibly for good.
